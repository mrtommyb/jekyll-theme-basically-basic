introduction: |
  *Are we alone?* This is a question that humanity has asked for millennia, finding an answer is beginning to fall within our grasp. I am focused moving us toward detecting life beyond the Solar System.

  I am an active researcher and lead several internationally leading science investigations. Additionally, I serve in science leadership positions on space mission and work to maximize their scientific return.

  - I'm the Deputy Director of the [TESS Science Support Center](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
  - I write [Software](software.html) that is primarily useful to scientists.
  - I give [talks about science](talks.html), and make [media appearances](media.html).
  - There are various [science projects](projects.html) that I'm involved in, including studying how planets form, discovering new exoplanets, and observing space weather on other stars.
