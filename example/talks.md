### PBS NewsHour Interview
NASA scientists say the Kepler space telescope may have discovered the most "Earth-like" planet yet. Circling a star about 500 light-years away, planet Kepler 186-F may be the right temperature to allow liquid water to flow on its surface. Hari Sreenivasan talks to Tom Barclay of NASA Ames Research Center about why this discovery is exciting to astronomers.

### My Path: Tom Barclay, Astronomer
Dr. Tom Barclay is a senior research scientist at NASA Ames Research Center. He spends his days studying stars and planets and how they formed. But before he became a scientist, he had all kinds of jobs from cleaning toilets to washing pots. He’s got some great advice about finding your own path. His advice:
"Say yes to scary things.""

### NASA TV: What's New in Aerospace?
*Focusing in on Other Worlds*

This episode of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s What's New in Aerospace? series, focuses on the abundance of confirmed and potential worlds that have been found outside of our solar system – commonly known as exoplanets. The program features experts discussing what we have learned so far in our exploration of exoplanets and how we will peer into the atmospheres of these faraway worlds to look for biomarkers, or signs of alien life. The What's New in Aerospace? series is presented in collaboration with NASA.

## Appearance Requests
The progress we have made in understanding our place in the Galaxy has been dramatic. I regularly present the this story of finding planets like our own to a diverse range of audiences. As we move toward finding life beyond Earth it is essential that we include everyone possible in this journey.

I am available for conferences and events around the world. I have been a guest on many TV shows around the world and bring energy and insight into the subject of exoplanet and the search for life. Please [contact me](mailto:tom@tombarclay.com) to check on my availability.
