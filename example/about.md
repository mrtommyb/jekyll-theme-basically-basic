I am a scientist studying planets orbiting distant stars. I am based at [NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard) in Greenbelt, MD where I serve as Deputy Director of the [TESS Science Support Center](http://bit.ly/tessgi).

I infer properties of [exoplanets](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/) and their host stars using data from space and ground-based telescopes. I have made several major discoveries, including the detection of the [smallest known planet](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v494/n7438/full/nature11914.html), the detection of the [first super-Earth-sized](https://www.space.com/24172-kepler-69c.html) planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star, and the detection of the [first Earth-sized planet](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6181/277) in the habitable zone of another star. I am a keen enabler of science and enjoy making NASA's mission great.

I grew up in Sheffield, UK. I was a Physics undergrad at the [University of Leeds](https://www.physics.leeds.ac.uk/). My Masters thesis work on Galactic dust emission was performed at the [Jodrell Bank Observatory, part of the University of Manchester](http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/). I then moved to Northern Ireland for my PhD where I worked at the Armagh Observatory. My thesis work was on measuring the population of ultra-compact white dwarf binaries.

After my PhD, I moved to NASA Ames Research Center, California as a research scientist within the Kepler Guest Observer Office and in 2014 I was promoted to Director of the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office. 

In 2017 I moved to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland to work on the TESS mission. 

I live in the Silver Spring, Maryland.
